Hierarchical clustering Institusion
    Two ways to do it:
        1.Agglomerative (Bottom Up Approach)
            Steps:
                a.Make a each data point a single point cluster - That forms N-Clusters
                b.Take the two closest points and make them a cluster. This makes N-1 Clusters
                c.Take two closest clusters and make them one cluster . This forms N-2 Clusters
                    ways to find distace between two clusters:
                        1.closest points distace
                        2.Furest points distance
                        3.distace between average of all points in the cluster
                        4.distace between the centroids
                d.Repad step-c until there is only one CLuster remains
